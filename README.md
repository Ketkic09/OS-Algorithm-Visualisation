# Aim
To Study OS algorithms with the help of visualization through computer
graphics
# Theory
Different OS algorithms like
FCFS (first come first serve), the process which arrives first is assigned the cpu first
and likewise all other processes are assigned the cpu,
SJF (shortest job first), the process having the least burst time is taken first then
the second least is taken and likewise all other processes are assigned the cpu,
Priority algorithm in which each process is assigned a priority and the process
with the highest priority is taken first
The above algorithms are solved and explained using shapes which are assigned
particular processes and according to its priority it goes in the cpu and average
waiting time is calculated through animation using random and time module in
Tkinter (Python) which makes it easy to understand and visualize.
